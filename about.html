                  <h3>What is my name? And what is the meaning of it?</h3>
                  <p>Siddhant Singh Chauhan. It means "Rules or Principals"</p>
                  <h3>About me</h3>
                  <p>I am a 19-year-old CS student in my second year of studies, pursuing my passion for computer science and technology. From a young age, I have always been fascinated by the power and potential of technology, and as I have grown older, my curiosity for the field have only intensified.<br>

                    As a student, I am dedicated to my studies and constantly striving to learn and grow. I am excited by the many opportunities and challenges that lie ahead of me as I continue on my educational journey, and I am eager to make the most of them.<br>
                     
                    Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a range of interests and hobbies that bring joy and balance to my life.<br>
                    
                    As I look towards the future, I am confident in my ability to succeed in the field of computer science. I know that there will be obstacles and setbacks along the way, but I am determined to overcome them and emerge stronger and more skilled. With hard work, dedication, and a love for what I do, I am excited to see what opportunities and achievements the future holds for me.</p>
                  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                  <p>I enjoy playing video games and reading novels, as well as listening to music. These activities help me relax and recharge my energy after a stressful day.<br> 
                  In addition to indoor hobbies, I also like to play basketball and chess (even though I'm not very good at it).</p>
                  <h3>What have I done so far in academics?</h3>
                  <p>I am a second-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Last semester, I completed the Foundation program, which covered basic C language and training courses.<br>
                  This year, I am learning basic Python, CPP (C++), HTML, data structures, and computer organization. I continue to build skills in Java and master the other languages.<br>
                  Next year, I hope to complete an internship that will provide me with real-life experience and important technological skills.</p>
